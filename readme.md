# Design Technologist Technical Screen

### Objective

Imagine you work in Smarter Technology’s virtual call center.

Your objective is to build an interface that allows humans to define the workflows required for LLM agents to make phone calls and collect information from insurers.

### Rules

- The designer has provided [this initial spec](https://www.figma.com/design/7vTkCQVrYdTxKnzSkeUtBU/Design-Technologist--Take-Home?node-id=0-1&t=DuPaeJauHbs1hSWW-1) for the the minimum viable product.
    - The UI displays nodes that represent questions that the LLM agent will ask, and edges (represented by arrows) that connect them together in a sequence.
- Clicking the “Add Node” button should append a new node to the end of the sequence (use predefined, static questions for the content of new nodes).
- Iconography should use [the Lucide icon set](https://lucide.dev).
